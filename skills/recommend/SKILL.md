name: recommend
description: Personalized movie recommendations tailored to the user's stored taste profile, watch history, and whatever mood/constraint they mention right now. Use when the user asks "what should I watch", "recommend me a movie", "suggest something", "I'm in the mood for [X]", "something like [X]", "help me pick a movie", "got two hours tonight — what should I watch", "anything I'd like that's new", or any other open-ended ask for a personalized pick. This is the flagship skill — invest in making each recommendation feel reasoned, not generic.

# recommend

You are giving the user a short, confident, personalized shortlist of movies — with reasoning tied to what you know about them.

## Before picks: check active state

Call `active_list` first. If any entry has `ageHours > 24` AND (`askedHoursAgo > 24` OR `lastAskedAt` is null), pick the OLDEST such entry and lead with ONE short prompt — not a wall of questions:

> Quick catch-up — you started **[Title](https://www.imdb.com/title/{imdbId}/)** on {short date}. How'd it go?
> - **a)** Finished, loved it
> - **b)** Finished, it was okay
> - **c)** Finished, didn't love it
> - **d)** Still watching
> - **e)** Dropped it

Route the answer:
- **a** → `watched_add({ movieId, rating: 5 })` + `active_remove({ movieId })`
- **b** → `watched_add({ movieId, rating: 3 })` + `active_remove({ movieId })`
- **c** → `watched_add({ movieId, rating: 2 })` + `active_remove({ movieId })`
- **d** → `active_touch_asked({ movieId })` (no watched entry, prevents re-asking within 24h)
- **e** → `active_remove({ movieId })` (no watched entry — they didn't really see it)

Only ever ask about ONE active entry per turn — the oldest. Then continue with the new picks below.

## Gather context (always)

Call these three MCP tools in parallel before anything else:
1. `preferences_get` — taste profile (now includes `likedInterests`, `likedCountries`, `likedLanguages`).
2. `watched_list` with `limit: 50` — exclude seen movies; use recent watches as signal.
3. `movies_genres` — for name↔id mapping when filtering.

## Choose a strategy based on the user's prompt

### A. "Something like [seed movie]"
1. `movies_search({ query })` → resolve seed to a TMDB ID. Confirm match if ambiguous.
2. `movies_recommendations({ movieId })` — TMDB's ML similar-movies. imdbapi.dev's `interestIds` are metadata tags, not real similarity; keep TMDB for this path.
3. Filter out movies already in `watched_list`. Filter out `dislikedGenres`. Pick the top 3–5.
4. **For each final pick, call `movies_details({ movieId })`** — this hydrates `imdbId`, IMDb rating, vote count, Metascore, and interest tags in one call. The link and rating fields in the output template depend on this. (TMDB's recommendations endpoint does NOT include `imdb_id` in list results — `movies_details` is the only path.)
5. Write a one-sentence "why it fits" per pick, anchored to either the seed or their taste profile.

### B. Rating-aware or thematic query ("good sci-fi rated 8+", "heist movies", "Japanese drama")
1. Route to `movies_imdb_discover`:
   - IMDb threshold → `minAggregateRating`.
   - Thematic subgenre → look up the `interestId` via `movies_imdb_interests` once per session, cache the mapping mentally, pass via `interestIds`.
   - Director/actor → `movies_imdb_find_name` → `nameIds`.
   - Language/country → `languageCodes` / `countryCodes`.
2. Merge the user's taste axes as soft biases: if they have `favoriteDirectors`, resolve one to a nameId and consider a second pass; if they have `likedInterests`, include them.
3. Filter out watched. Pick 3–5 with brief "why it fits" reasoning.

### C. Mood / constraint query ("atmospheric thriller under 2 hours", "feel-good comedy", "nothing too heavy")
1. Translate mood → genre filters. Use `movies_genres` if unsure of IDs.
2. Call `movies_discover` with:
   - `genres` from the mood
   - `excludeGenres` from `dislikedGenres`
   - `minRating: 6.5` and `minVotes: 300` by default (quality floor). If the user hinted at quality ("something actually good"), set `minImdbRating: 7` — that flips routing to imdbapi.dev automatically.
   - Runtime filters when they mention a time budget
   - `sortBy: "popularity.desc"` unless they want something obscure
3. Filter out watched. Pick 3–5.
4. **For each final pick, call `movies_details({ movieId })`** — hydrates `imdbId` + IMDb rating needed for the output template. Skip this and the format below cannot render correctly.
5. Write brief "why it fits" reasoning per pick.

### D. "What should I watch tonight" (no constraint given)
1. Combine signals: mix top 2–3 from `movies_trending` (week) with 1–2 from `movies_discover` using `likedGenres` and `favoriteDirectors`, and 1 from `movies_imdb_discover` using `likedInterests` when present.
2. Cross-reference `favoriteMovies` → fetch `movies_recommendations` on one of them for variety.
3. De-duplicate, filter watched, pick 3–5.
4. **For each final pick, call `movies_details({ movieId })`** — hydrates `imdbId`, IMDb rating, vote count, Metascore, and interest tags. The picks coming from `movies_imdb_discover` already have an `imdbId`, but TMDB-sourced picks do NOT — call `movies_details` on those before rendering. (Note: `movies_imdb_batch_rating` only fetches ratings for known imdbIds; it can't backfill imdbIds from TMDB IDs, so it's not the right tool here.)

## Present the recommendations

Format each pick as:

```
**[Title](https://www.imdb.com/title/{imdbId}/)** (Year[, Country]) — IMDb 8.2 — 128 min
[Genre, Genre] · [Heist, Neo-Noir] (if interest tags present)
One-to-two sentence hook from the overview.
→ Why for you: [specific reason anchored to their profile or the current ask]
```

**Output contract (non-negotiable).**
- **Title format:** `**[Title](https://www.imdb.com/title/{imdbId}/)**` — bold + IMDb link. The `imdbId` comes from `movies_details({ movieId })`, which every strategy above requires per pick. If `movies_details` returned `imdbId: null` after that call, fall back to plain bold `**Title**` with no link.
- **❌ Never use a TMDB URL** (`themoviedb.org/movie/...`, `themoviedb.org/title/...`) anywhere in the output. The TMDB ID is internal plumbing — users don't read it. Plain bold `**Title**` is the ONLY acceptable degraded state when `imdbId` is unavailable.
- **Rating:** IMDb rating only (`IMDb 8.2`). If `movies_details` returned no IMDb rating after hydration, fall back to `TMDB 7.9`. Never dual-list (`IMDb X · TMDB Y`) unless the user explicitly asks to see both scores.

Close with: *"Pick one to start? I'll mark it active so we can check in next time."*

## Auto-capture: pickup → active

When the user replies with **clear intent** — *"I'll watch X tonight"*, *"starting X now"*, *"going with X"*, *"let's do X"* — call `active_add({ movieId, source: "recommend" })` BEFORE acknowledging. Then confirm in one sentence: *"Got it — marked **[X](imdb)** active. I'll ask how it went next time."*

When the reply is **ambiguous** — *"X looks good"*, *"might watch X"*, *"X sounds interesting"* — ask once: *"Want me to mark it as active so I can check in next time?"*

Other auto-updates:
- If they reject all suggestions with a reason ("too slow", "nothing with horror"), immediately call `preferences_set` to update `dislikedGenres` or `avoidKeywords` so future runs improve.
- If they volunteer language/country love ("more Korean stuff please") → `preferences_set({ likedCountries: ["KR"] })` or `likedLanguages: ["ko"]`.
- If they clearly like a theme ("love heist films") → map to an `interestId` and store via `likedInterests`.
- "Save X for later" (no watching intent) → `watchlist_add` or `list_add` if they named a list.

## Quality bar

- Every recommendation must come from TMDB or imdbapi.dev data (never invent titles).
- Keep the shortlist tight: 3 confident picks beats 10 hedged ones.
- "Why for you" must be *specific* to the user, not generic. Anchor to preferences, a recent watch, the current mood, or the IMDb signal when it's surprisingly strong.
- For fresh query patterns, consult `docs/api-reference/imdbapi-dev.md` and `docs/api-reference/tmdb.md`.
